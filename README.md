# NUTRISSENCE :leaves:



Our brand focuses on providing our users with information that will help take control of their diet. They will be able to judge for themselves what recipes are good for them and which ones they should avoid, depending on the type of diet they wish to focus on.

## Home Page :house:



The home page features mainly our search engine. However, only users that have created an account and logged in will be able to access that functionality. So make sure to sign up to get the most out of our brand! 



Our search engine works on a keyword basis. In other words, our users will be able to search food recipes based on ingredients that they like. For example, entering "avocado" in the search bar will retrieve all kinds of dishes that involve that ingredient. The types of dishes can range from drinks to complete meals, based on the ingredients being searched.

## My Favorites :hearts:



If you wish to add recipes that caught your attention (whether you'd like to reproduce them or avoid them), the **_My Favorites_** feature is a great way to save them in one area.

Users will have the option to add recipes to that page, but will also be able to remove them from that very same page. In addition, by clicking on the name of the recipe in the **_My Favorites_**, users will be redirected to the recipes' own URL where they can view those recipes in more detail. 



This is a great a feature for our **LOGGED IN** users. What does this mean? This means that only users individuals that have created an account AND have signed in will be able to see this feature in the navbar of the website.
